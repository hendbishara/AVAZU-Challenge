# AVAZU Challenge - Predicting Click-Through Rate (CTR)

This project was created as part of a university Machine Learning course and aims to solve Kaggle's **AVAZU Challenge**, which focuses on predicting the click-through rate (CTR) for online advertisements. The project employs multiple machine learning methods and compares their results to evaluate performance.

## ðŸ“‹ Project Overview

The AVAZU Challenge involves predicting whether a user will click on an ad based on anonymized categorical features. The dataset contains millions of data points, making it a large-scale challenge that requires efficient processing and robust modeling techniques.

This project explores and compares the following machine learning models:
- **Logistic Regression**
- **Decision Trees**
- **Random Forest**
- **XGBoost**
